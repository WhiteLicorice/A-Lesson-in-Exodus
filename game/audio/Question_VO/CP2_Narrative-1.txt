S: Today, we'll be discussing classical and model-dependent realism. /3

Classical and model-dependent realism? /2 (Narrator2)

S: That's right. Classical realism claims that there's an objective reality independent of our observations and theories./4

That must mean that there's a singular truth. A true description of reality. (Narrator3)

S: In classical realism, we scientists craft theories to accurately describe the truth of reality. /5

Sen Sei paces around the board.(Narrator4)

S: The second approach is model-dependent realism. What does that mean? /6

It means that reality depends on multiple models? (Narrator5)

S: Well, in model-dependent realism, our grasp of reality is limited by our models and theories. Reality is understood through various models. These models may offer differing descriptions of reality. A single theory may not capture what reality is. It's quite a philosophical approach to science.  /7

Question: Model-dependent realism asserts that theories cannot capture the truth of reality.(Question1)

	> False
		pass
	> It depends...
		pass

if event_timer is end:
	end quiz1_q1
else:
	goto quiz1_q1

S: The correct answer is False. In model-dependent realism, theories may capture the truth of reality, but only in their respective domains. For instance, in model-dependent realism, Newtonian physics accurately describes motion under gravity in everyday scenarios, while Einstein's general relativity offers a more precise description in extreme conditions like near black holes. /10

Question: Classical realism seeks to discover the existence or non-existence of ghosts. (Question2)

label quiz1_q2:
	> True
		pass
	> False
		pass
	
if event_timer is end:
	end quiz1_q2
else:
	goto quiz1_q2

S: The correct answer is True. Classical realism seeks to understand the existence or non-existence of phenomena based on an objective reality independent of human perception. In the case of ghosts, classical realists would approach the question by investigating empirical evidence and logical reasoning to determine whether such entities exist within the framework of objective reality. /11

Question: In model-dependent realism, which came first: reality or the model? (Question3)

	> Model
		pass
	> They came to be at the same time.
		pass

if event_timer is end:
	end quiz1_q3
else:
	goto quiz1_q3

S: The model comes first. In model-dependent realism, our reality is shaped by the conceptual models or theories we create to interpret our observations and experiences. These models serve as frameworks through which we perceive and make sense of reality, implying that the model precedes our understanding of what is real and what is not. /12

Question: Model-dependent realism asserts that there exists no truth in reality. On the other hand, classical realism asserts that there exists a truth behind reality.(Question4)

start event_timer

while event_timer not end:

label quiz1_q3:
	> True
		pass
	> False
		pass
	> It depends...
		pass

if event_timer is end:
	end quiz1_q4
else:
	goto quiz1_q4

S: The correct answer is true. In model-dependent realism, truth may be relative and context-dependent, influenced by the conceptual models or theories we use to interpret reality. However, within each model, there exists a notion of truth that corresponds to the accuracy of that model in describing and predicting phenomena within its domain. /13

Question: In model-dependent realism, truth is an absolute concept.(Question5)

start event_timer

while event_timer not end:

label quiz1_q5:
	> True
        	pass
	> False
        	pass
	> Truth doesn't exist.
		pass
	> It depends...
        	pass

if event_timer is end:
    end quiz1_q5
else:
    goto quiz1_q5

S: It depends. As in, it depends on the context and the framework of the model. In model-dependent realism, truth is not always absolute. Instead, it depends on the context and the framework within which it is interpreted. While some models may provide a more absolute conception of truth within their specific domain, others may allow for more relative interpretations. Therefore, whether truth is absolute or relative in model-dependent realism varies based on the particular model being considered and the context in which it is applied. /14

Counting the scores... Not too shabby. (Narrator9)

S:  I see that some of you aren't paying attention. From this point forward, hold on to your paper. I will be asking questions that will be answered as a group, timed, and graded accordingly. Let's move on to the story of a very interesting man and how he determined that the universe is expanding. /15

Edwin Hubble. A 20th century American scientist who played a crucial role in establishing extragalctic astronomy and observational cosmology. (Narrator10)

S: In the twentieth century, ages ago, Edwin Hubble set his sights on the heavens. He used the 100-inch Hooker Telescope, the worldâ€™s largest at the time, to observe faint, fuzzy, cloud-like patches of light in the cosmos. What are these patches of light called? /17

S: These patches of light were nebula. Nebulae. Up until the early 20th century, our perception of the cosmos fell within the boundaries of the Milky Way. There were speculations of other galaxies. However, it wasn't until Hubble turned his telescope on Andromeda that our perception would change. /18

load asset_andromeda

The Andromeda galaxy. Our nearest galactical neighbor. (Narrator12)

S: Back then, Andromeda was believed to be a nebula. Hubble studied the light emitted from Andromeda and concluded that Andromeda was a galaxy as well. He used this technique to discover other galaxies. /19

The Doppler Effect applied to light, aptly named redshift. Light from a distance appears displaced towards the red end of the spectrum. (Narrator13)

S: The redshift of light from distant galaxies indicates that they're moving away from us. The greater the redshift, the faster the galaxies are moving away. This led to the conception of Hubble's Law. Can anyone guess what Hubble's Law states? /20

S: Hubble's Law states that the velocity of a galaxy is directly proportional to its distance from us. This observation provided compelling evidence for the expansion of the universe. Hubble's Law also implies that the universe expands uniformly across all directions. /21

A single innocuous question appears on the board.(Narrator14)

Question: Does Edwin Hubble's study of the cosmos align with model-dependent realism or classical realism? (Question6)

end question_a12

if event_timer is end:
    end question_a13
else:
    goto question_a13

S: The answer is classical realism. Edwin Hubble's study of the cosmos aligns more closely with classical realism. His work was grounded in empirical observation and aimed to uncover an objective truth about the universe, consistent with the principles of classical realism. Hubble's observations, such as the discovery of the expanding universe and the formulation of Hubble's Law, contributed to our understanding of the cosmos as an objective reality governed by natural laws. /22

S: This leads us to our next topic of discussion. How did the universe come about, anyway? /23

The Big Bang. That's something that everyone knows.(Narrator15)

load asset_bigbgang

S: About 14 billions years ago, the Big Bang occured. Despite the name, the Big Bang wasn't a violent explosion. Instead, it was the rapid expansion of a very hot and very dense universe, filled with quarks, gluons, and other elementary particles. /24

So it didn't explode like a bomb. (Narrator16)

S: As the universe expanded and cooled, quarks merged together to form protons and neutrons, which then combined to form atomic nuclei, such as hydrogen and helium. This occured about a hundred seconds after the Big Bang. What do you think is the name of this phenomena? /25

S: Stars manufactured these elements. Life-supporting elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen primarily originate from the nuclear fusion processes that occur within stars. During the later stages of stellar evolution, massive stars undergo nucleosynthesis, where heavier elements are formed through fusion reactions in their cores. When these stars eventually explode in supernova events, they release these elements into space, enriching the interstellar medium with the building blocks of life. Subsequently, these elements are incorporated into new generations of stars, planets, and ultimately, life forms. /30

S: Now, we have our last topic for the day. We'll be tracing the evolution of a high-mass star. /31

load asset_star_one

S: A high-mass star starts its life as a main sequence star, burning hydrogen into helium in its core. You may think of stars as a nuclear powerplant, where nuclear fusion reigns supreme. /32

load asset_star_two

S: As the star exhausts its hydrogen fuel, it expands and becomes a red supergiant. /33

load asset_star_three

S: The core of the star contracts and heats up, and it starts burning helium into carbon and oxygen. /34

load asset_star_four

S: The outer layers of the star expand and cool, and the star becomes larger and brighter. /35

load asset_star_five

S: The core of the star continues to contract and heat up, and it starts burning heavier elements, such as carbon, oxygen, and so on. /36

load asset_star_six

S: Eventually, the core of the star becomes so hot and dense that it forms a degenerate iron core. /37

load asset_star_seven

S: The iron core is unable to sustain nuclear fusion, and it collapses under its own gravity, leading to a supernova explosion. /38

load asset_star_eight

S: The supernova explosion scatters the outer layers of the star into space, and it forms a neutron star or a black hole, depending on the mass of the core. /39
